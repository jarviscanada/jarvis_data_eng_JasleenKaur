**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JasleenKaur.git/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Helped develop a user-friendly solution to manage a 10-server cluster. Responsibilities included recording the hardware specifications of each node and monitoring real-time resource usage. It was achieved using bash scripts for data collection, PostgreSQL for data storage, Docker for consistent execution and compatibility, and Git for version control. The collected data facilitated the generation of reports to support future resource planning, such as adding or removing servers. This project honed my skills in system administration, scripting, and database management, ensuring efficient cluster performance and scalability.


## Highlighted Projects
**SAP Survey Automation**: To improve accuracy and efficiency, I automated the SAP Survey t-code procedure. Excel sheets were used as the process's primary input, and they were later transformed into an orderly XML format that included the creation of a GUID. The surveys were then prepared for distribution by integrating the XML into the survey t-code. This involved understanding the schema of the Survey Database and investigating the process with the help of manual debugging. Additionally, I automated the survey distribution process and ensured seamless recording of responses into the database. This project streamlined survey management, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors and also the need for third-party vendors.

**Software Development**: Contributed to the development of antimyatra.com by designing and implementing the software architecture and schema for the website. My role involved creating detailed system schemas to support the platform's core functionalities, including hospital formalities, cremation arrangements, and paperwork management. I also developed the final proposal for the project, outlining technical specifications and implementation strategies. This work ensured that the platform could efficiently handle user requests and integrate with external systems while adhering to traditional practices for performing final rites.
