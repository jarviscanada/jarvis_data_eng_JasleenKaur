      "description": "To improve accuracy and efficiency, I automated the SAP Survey t-code procedure.Excel sheets were used as the process's primary input, and they were later transformed into an orderly XML format that included the creation of a GUID.The surveys were then prepared for distribution by integrating the XML into the survey t-code. This involved understanding the schema of the Survey Database and investigating the process with the help of manual debugging.Additionally, I automated the survey distribution process and ensured seamless recording of responses into the database. This project streamlined survey management, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors and also the need for third-party vendors.",
