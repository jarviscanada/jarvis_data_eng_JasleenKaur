### Question 1: show all members



## Part 3  - SQL Queries 

#### Question 1 - The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the facilities table. Use the following values:

facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
#### Answer 1:
 insert into cd.facilities\
    (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)\
    values (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);  

#### Question 2 - Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:

Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
#### Answer 2: 

insert into cd.facilities. \
    (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance) \
    select (select max(facid) from cd.facilities)+1, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800 ;  

#### Question 3 - We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. The initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix the error.
#### Answer 3 :
update cd.facilities \
    set initialoutlay = 10000 \
    where name = 'Tennis Court 2';

#### Question 4 - We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.
#### Answer 4 -
update cd.facilities \
    set \
        membercost = (select membercost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0), \
        guestcost = (select guestcost * 1.1 from cd.facilities where facid = 0) \
    where facid = 1;  

#### Question 5 - As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings from the cd.bookings table. How can we accomplish this?
#### Answer 5: 
delete from cd.bookings;

#### Question 6 - We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database. How can we achieve that?
#### Answer 6: 
delete from cd.members where memid = 37;

###    BASICS 

#### Question 7 - How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.
#### Answer 7:
select facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance \
	from cd.facilities \
	where \
		membercost > 0 and \ 
		(membercost < 0.02* monthlymaintenance);  

#### Question 8 - How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?
#### Answer 8:
select * \
	from cd.facilities \ 
		where \
		name like '%Tennis%';  

#### Question 9 - How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR operator.
#### Answer 9:
select * \
	from cd.facilities \ 
		where \
		facid in (1,5); 

#### Question 10 - How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.
#### Answer 10:
select memid, surname, firstname, joindate \ 
		from cd.members \
		where joindate >= '2012-09-01';  

#### Question 11 - You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names. Yes, this is a contrived example :-). Produce that list!
#### Answer 11 -
select surname \
	from cd.members\
union\
select name \
	from cd.facilities;  

### JOIN 

#### Question 12 - How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?
#### Answer 12:
select starttime\
from cd.bookings  as b\
inner join cd.members as m\
on b.memid = m.memid \
and m.firstname = 'David 
and m.surname = 'Farrell';

#### Question 13 - How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.
#### Answer 13:
select b.starttime as start, f.name as name \
	from cd.bookings as b \
inner join cd.facilities as f \
	on b.facid = f.facid \
where \
	f.name like '%Tennis%Court%' \
and \
	b.starttime >= '2012-09-21' and \
	b.starttime < '2012-09-22â€™ \
order by b.starttime ;

#### Question 14 - How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any)? Ensure that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).
#### Answer 14:
select m.firstname as memfname, \
	   m.surname as memsname, \
	   r.firstname as recfname, \
	   r.surname as recsname,\
from cd.members as m\
left outer join cd.members as r \
on m.recommendedby = r.memid\
order by memsname, memfname;

#### Question 15 - How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).
#### Answer 15
select distinct r.firstname as firstname, r.surname as surname \
	from cd.members as m \
	inner join cd.members as r \ 
		on m.recommendedby = r.memid \ 
		order by surname, firstname;

#### Question 16 - How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.
#### Answer 16: 
select recommendedby, count(*) \
	 from cd.member s\ 
 	where recommendedby is not null\
 	group by recommendedby\
 	order by recommendedby;
